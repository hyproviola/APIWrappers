# APIWrappers
> Wrappers for various APIs, in various programming languages.

The goal of this project is to build API wrappers for
a multitude of service APIs from imgur, dropbox, and discord,
to transaction networks like Visa and Mastercard, and bulk 
information extraction from government sites, surveys
sites and lots more.

## What to Expect

* We would like to include multiple implementations such as:
    * Websocket wrappers for back and forth communication
    * Send a request and capture the response
* Ability to access the API without creating entire requests
and instead pass configurable data to a function for that
request.
* Functions to perform complex tasks outlined by the API
documentation.
* Functions to perform other complex tasks related to
various use cases. For example:
    * Listing content of dropbox folder
    * Looping through elements and performing actions
    * Other functionalities present in the UI for the
service with said API.

## Wrapper Documentation

Documentation for wrappers can be found in their
respective folders (./README.md). Documentation for
the entirety of the APIWrappers repository can be found
on the repository (wiki)[#]
